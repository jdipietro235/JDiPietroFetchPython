		<p>Accept a list of email addresses, then return an integer indicating the number of unique email addresses.</p>
		<p>Where unique email addresses means they will be delivered to the same account using Gmail account matching. 
			Specifically: Gmail will ignore the placement of "." in the username. 
			And it will ignore any portion of the username after a "+".</p>
